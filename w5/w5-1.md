# Week 5 - Implement the storage module

## Code Along Instructions

## Steps

1. **Continue working in `w5` folder**

2. **Week 5.1: Implement the storage module.**
* Code Along 5.1 - Part 1: What is LocalStorage
    - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfEs3R25uwk) - Right click and open in a new tab or window
        * In the `w5` folder create a new JS file named 'storage.js`
        - Comments to include
            - `app.js`
                 - // Week 5.1: Now save entries to localStorage after submission.
            - `storage.js`
                - // This module handles all interactions with localStorage for our carbon footprint entries.
                - // A unique key to identify our data in localStorage.
                - // SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE - This naming convention is typically reserved for global constants whose value should never change throughout the lifetime of the application.
                -  // Let's learn about localStorage

* Code Along 5.1 - Part 2: Code save entries  and unique id function 
    - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljy1QLWXqTY) - Right click and open in a new tab or window
        - Comments to include
            - `storage.js`
                - // Saves the given array of entries to localStorage.
                - // This is the primary function for persisting the current state of our entries.
                - @param {Array} entries - The array of carbon footprint entry objects to save.
                - // 
                - // localStorage can only store strings. We must convert our JavaScript array of objects
                - // into a JSON string using JSON.stringify() before saving.
                - // 
            - `app.js`
                - // Save the entire 'carbonFootprintEntries' array to localStorage using our storage module.
            - `storage.js`
                - // Try Catch Block - Error Checking
                - //
                - // Generates a simple, unique ID for a new entry based on the current timestamp.
                - // This function is now part of the storage module as it's related to data management. 
                - // @returns {string} A unique ID string.
            - `app.js`
                - // Now using storage.generateUniqueId() for our newEntry object literal
                - // This is a quick and simple way to get a generally unique ID based on a high-resolution numeric timestamp

        - Comments to include
            - `storage.js`
                - // Loads all carbon footprint entries from localStorage.
                - // @returns {Array} An array of carbon footprint entry objects. Returns an empty array if no data is found or if parsing fails.
                - // If data exists, parse the JSON string back into a JavaScript array/object.
                - // If no data is found in localStorage, return an empty array.
                - // localStorage can only store strings. We must convert our JavaScript array of objects
                - // into a JSON string using JSON.stringify() before saving.
                - // In case of corrupted data, it's good practice to clear it to prevent continuous errors.
            - `app.js`
                - // On startup, attempt to load any previously saved entries from localStorage.
                - // carbonFootprintEntries array using the spread operator (...).
