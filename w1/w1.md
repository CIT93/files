# Week 1 - Who's in the House

## Code Along Instructions

These instructions will guide you through setting up your first web project and getting familiar with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Setup

* **Repository Access:** Ensure you've either cloned your public GitHub repository locally or created a CodeSpace for it. (If you're unsure which to use, CodeSpaces are often quicker for initial setup.)
* **Install Live Server Extension:**
    * **Prompt for Instructions:** Use the following prompt to get detailed installation steps:
        ```
        Give instructions on how to install live server extension in vscode
        ```
    * **Run Live Server:** Once installed, start the Live Server (e.g., by clicking "**Go Live**" in the VS Code status bar).
* **Enable Auto Save:** Make sure auto save is turned on in VS Code to automatically save your changes.

### Steps

1.  **Create Project Files:**
    * In your public repository, **create a new folder** named `w1`.
    * Inside the `w1` folder, create the following three files:
        * `index.html`
        * `app.js`
        * `style.css`

2.  **Configure `index.html`:**
    * In the first line of the `index.html` file, type `!` and press `Tab` (or `Enter`).
        * **Emmet Shortcut:** This is a powerful shortcut using the built-in [Emmet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) to generate a basic HTML5 boilerplate.
        * **Understand Emmet Output:** To learn more about the code created by Emmet, use this prompt:
            ```
            When starting a new HTML file and using emmet explain what the ! does and the code generated
            ```
    * **Link CSS and JavaScript:** After the `<meta>` tags and before the closing `</head>` tag, code the following to link your stylesheet and script:
        ```html
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
        <script src="app.js"></script>
        <title>Week 1 - Who's in the HOUSE!</title>
        ```
    * **Add Body Content:** After the opening `<body>` tag, code the following HTML content:
        ```html
        <h1>Your name is in the house!</h1>
        <p>This page is powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        ```

3.  **Configure `app.js`:**
    * In the `app.js` file, add the following JavaScript code:
        ```javascript
        console.log('Hello from app.js! Your JavaScript is connected and running!');
        ```
    * **Verify JavaScript Connection:**
        * With Live Server running, open your browser's **Developer Console** (usually by pressing `F12` or `Cmd + Option + I` on macOS).
        * Navigate to the **`Console`** tab to see the message from your `app.js` file, confirming your JavaScript is connected.

    * **Git Workflow (Save Progress):**
        * Commit your changes with the message: **"index.html and app.js setup"**
        * Push your changes to your GitHub repository.
        * **Check GitHub Pages:** Open your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., `https://cit93.github.io/your-pub/w1/`). Note that it may take a few seconds to several minutes for changes to appear, depending on server updates.

4.  **Configure `style.css`:**
    * Copy the following CSS code into your `style.css` file:
        ```css
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            margin: 20px;
            background-color: #f4f4f4; /* A light grey background */
            color: #333;
        }

        h1 {
            color: #0056b3;
        }

        p {
            line-height: 1.6;
        }
        ```
    * **Understand CSS:** To learn more about the provided CSS properties, use a prompt like this:
        ```
        Explain the CSS properties used in the following code:
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            margin: 20px;
            background-color: #f4f4f4; /* A light grey background */
            color: #333;
        }

        h1 {
            color: #0056b3;
        }

        p {
            line-height: 1.6;
        }
        ```
    * **Personalize Styles:** Feel free to update the CSS selectors and property values to your personal preference.

    * **Git Workflow (Save Progress):**
        * Commit your changes with the message: **"css styles copied and updated"**
        * Push your changes to your GitHub repository.
        * **Check GitHub Pages:** Again, check your GitHub Pages URL to see the updated styles reflecting on your page.

5.  **Canvas Instructions:**
    * Follow the instructions provided in Canvas to complete this work and submit it.
