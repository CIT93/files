# Week 10 Challenge: Final Validation Cleanup & Error Display

### **Part 1: Building the Cleanup Mechanism**

The first rule of form validation is: **Always clear old errors before checking for new ones.**

**Action:** Create a new function named `clearErrorMessages` in your `app.js` file.

**Task:**

1.  **Define the Function:** Write the complete function definition for `clearErrorMessages( )`.
2.  **Implement Cleanup for All Spans:** Inside this function, implement the necessary DOM manipulation to completely hide and empty the text content of **all 11 error message spans** (`householdMembersError`, `homeSquareFootageError`, `dietTypeError`, etc.).

**Outcome:** You will have a reusable function that, when called, visually resets the entire error system.

### **Part 2: Integrating the Cleanup and Visibility Toggle**

**Task:**

1.  **Initial Cleanup (Placement?):**  Where would you call clearErrorMessages to ensures that any errors displayed from the previous failed attempt are wiped clean before running the current set of checks?
Also, ensure this new cleanup function is called by the central application state reset function.

2.  **Error Visibility (The Fix):** Go through **all 11 existing `if` blocks** within `validateForm`. In each block where you currently set `errorSpan.textContent = '...';` and `isValid = false;`, you must **immediately follow** the `textContent` line by adding the code to make that specific error span visible:

    ```javascript
    // Example of the required action inside the failing rule:
    if (formData.householdMembers < 1) {
        householdMembersError.textContent = 'Household members must be at least 1.';
        // ADD NEW CODE HERE: Make the error span visible!
        isValid = false;
    }
    ```

**Outcome:**

* **Successful Submissions:** When a user submits valid data, any old errors are cleared at the start, and the submission proceeds correctly.
* **Failed Submissions:** When a user submits invalid data, all old errors are cleared, and only the new, current errors are displayed correctly beneath their corresponding inputs, preventing the form from submitting.
