# Week 10 Challenge: Final Validation Cleanup & Error Display

**Goal:** Transform your current validation logic from a state where errors are calculated silently, to a fully functional system where errors are visible to the user and correctly cleared before every new submission attempt.

This challenge focuses on implementing the critical cleanup functions and integrating them into your existing `handleFormSubmit` workflow.

### **Part 1: Building the Cleanup Mechanism**

The first rule of form validation is: **Always clear old errors before checking for new ones.**

**Action:** Create a new function named `clearErrorMessages` in your `app.js` file.

**Task:**

1.  **Define the Function:** Write the complete function definition for `clearErrorMessages( )`.
2.  **Implement Cleanup for All Spans:** Inside this function, implement the necessary DOM manipulation to completely hide and empty the text content of **all 11 error message spans** (`householdMembersError`, `homeSquareFootageError`, `dietTypeError`, etc.).
    * For each span, set its **`textContent` to an empty string (`''`)**.
    * For each span, set its **`style.display` property to `'none'`** (this is the CSS property that ensures the error disappears and takes up no space).

**Outcome:** You will have a reusable function that, when called, visually resets the entire error system.

### **Part 2: Integrating the Cleanup and Visibility Toggle**

Now you need to make sure your newly created `clearErrorMessages()` function runs at the correct time, and that your failing rules successfully display the error.

**Action:** Update your `validateForm` and `handleFormSubmit` functions.

**Task:**

1.  **Initial Cleanup (Placement):** Modify the `validateForm` function so that the very **first line of code** inside it is a call to your new `clearErrorMessages()` function. (This ensures that any errors displayed from the previous failed attempt are wiped clean before running the current set of checks).
2.  **Error Visibility (The Fix):** Go through **all 11 existing `if` blocks** within `validateForm`. In each block where you currently set `errorSpan.textContent = '...';` and `isValid = false;`, you must **immediately follow** the `textContent` line by adding the code to make that specific error span visible:

    ```javascript
    // Example of the required action inside the failing rule:
    if (formData.householdMembers < 1) {
        householdMembersError.textContent = 'Household members must be at least 1.';
        // ADD NEW CODE HERE: Make the error span visible!
        isValid = false;
    }
    ```

**Outcome:**

* **Successful Submissions:** When a user submits valid data, any old errors are cleared at the start, and the submission proceeds correctly.
* **Failed Submissions:** When a user submits invalid data, all old errors are cleared, and only the new, current errors are displayed correctly beneath their corresponding inputs, preventing the form from submitting.
