            - `app.js`
                - // ---  Part 1: Function, EventListener and References ---
                - 
                - // The main initialization function for our application.
                - // This function sets up all the event listeners.
                - // The 'DOMContentLoaded' event is crucial!
                - App initialized: DOM is ready! Try submitting the form or clearing it.
                - 
                - // We get references to the HTML elements our JavaScript needs to interact with.
                - // We use 'const' because these references themselves won't change, even if their content does.
                - // Get a reference to the main form element by its ID.
                - 
                - // Using form.querySelector() is good practice for elements inside a specific parent (our form).
                - 
                - // Get a reference to the 'Clear Form' button.

                - // Handles the Form submission event.
                - // Handles the Clear Form button. 
                - 
                - // Attach the 'submit' event listener to our main form.
                - // When the form is submitted, the 'handleFormSubmit' function will be called.
                - 
                - // Attach the 'click' event listener to our "Clear Form" button.
                - // When the button is clicked, the 'handleClearForm' function will be called.

        - Prompts to check out:
                - Explain the defer attribute in HTML `<script>` tags and the DOMContentLoaded event in JavaScript. Describe what each does individually and how they work together to load web pages efficiently and reliably.
                - What are the most common types of events that JavaScript event listeners react to on a web page, and what basic interactions do they represent

* Code Along Part 2: Code handleFormSubmit and handleClearForm Functions 
    - - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5Y-pfYmvuU) - Right click and open in a new tab or window
        - Comments to include 
            - app.js
                - // --- Part 2:  Code handleFormSubmit and handleClearForm Functions ---
                - 
                - // @param {Event} event - The event object provided by the browser.
                - // IMPORTANT: event.preventDefault()
                - // This stops the browser's default behavior of reloading the page when a form is submitted.
                - 
                - // The '.value' property always returns a string.
                - // parseInt() converts that string into a whole number.
                - // The '|| 1' is a safety net: if the input is empty or invalid, it defaults to 1. 
                - // Log the collected data to the console.
                - 
                - // The form.reset() method is a built-in browser function that resets all form fields
                - // back to their initial values as defined in the HTML. 
                - // Manually ensure the default value for 'householdMembers' is 1. 
        - Prompts to check out:
            - Explain the purpose of event.preventDefault() in event handling, specifically for form submissions.
            - Describe how parseInt() and the || operator work together to safely process user input from HTML forms.
            - Compare and contrast how form.reset() and manually setting an input's .value property affect form fields.
            - Research the JavaScript Event object: what information does it contain, and how can you access it?

* Code Along Part 3: Implement the form-handler.js module
    - - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yMQ7ka5Jas) - Right click and open in a new tab or window
        * In the `w3` folder create a new JS file named `form-handler.js`
        - Comments to include
            - `form-handler.js`
                - --- Part 3: Implement the form-handler.js module ---
                - // form-handler.js
                - // This module handles getting input values from the form and clearing it.

                - // Simplified: Only focuses on Household Size input for now. 
                - // Clears all input fields in the form and resets default selections. 
                - // In this phase, it only affects the 'Household Size' input. 
            - `app.js`
                - // Import the form-handler module so we can use its functions.
                - // The path './form-handler.js' tells JavaScript where to find the module file.`
            - `index.html`
                - updating script tag to add type=module
            - `form-handler.js`
                - // Update to export clearForm function
            - `app.js`
                - // Update script tag for type="module"
            - `form-handler.js`
                - // Collects the 'Household Size' input value from the form.
                - // In this phase, we only focus on this one input.
                - // Refactor householdMembers input field from app.js
            - Do the following:
                - Create a new file name it app3-1.js and copy the existing code from the app.js, so you will have the comments. 
                - Than copy the app.js into your favorite LLM, after you provide it this prompt:
                    `Refactor the provided JavaScript code by adding concise summary comments before each function and DOM reference. Ensure there are no comments inside the function blocks. The comments should briefly describe the purpose of the function or reference.`
        - Prompts to check out
            - For a beginner JavaScript programmer, explain what a 'module' is and why it's useful for organizing code. Then, describe how the export keyword makes code available from a module, and how the import keyword allows you to use that exported code in another JavaScript file.
            - What does type="module" do in the index.html
