# Week 4.1 - Implement the calculator module

## Code Along Instructions

## Steps

1. **Project files setup and reviewed in week 4 attendance**

2. **Week 4.1: Implement the calculator.js module.**
* Code Along 4.1 - Part 1: Create calculator.js module and code household points function
    - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4g6fwsMQtM) - Right click and open in a new tab or window
        * In the `w4` folder create a new JS file named './calculator.js`
        - Comments to include
            - `app.js`
                - // ---  4.1 - Part 1: Create calculator.js module and code household points function ---
                - // 
            - `calculator.js`
                - // This module contains the core logic for calculating carbon footprint points.
                - // Calculate points for each category using our dedicated helper functions
                - // This function orchestrates calls to the smaller, specialized calculation functions.
                - // It exports 'calculateFootprint' so other modules (like app.js) can use it.
                - // Return the breakdown of points for each category, and the total (for now we will just setup a key and return it's value)
            - `app.js`
                - // Calculate the carbon footprint points using our calculator module.
                - // console.log hardcoded object literal
            - `calculator.js`
                - // Calculates points for Household Size based on WikiHow Method 1.
                - // @param {number} householdMembers - Number of people in the household.
                - omits block delimiters for single statements
                - // Include householdMember in return object literal
                - // 6+ people total
                - // Default or invalid input

* Code Along 4.1 - Part 2: Code Home Size and Food Diet Points
    - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFPMo9mtzJg) - Right click and open in a new tab or window
        - Comments to include 
            - `calculator.js`
                - // Calculates points for Home Size based on WikiHow Method 1
                - // @param {number} homeSquareFootage - Square footage of the home.
                - // @param {boolean} isApartment - True if dwelling is an apartment.
                - // @returns {number} Points for home size.
                - comment above calculateFootprint
                - // @param {Object} data - An object containing input values for the categories:
                - // householdMembers (number)
                - // homeSquareFootage (number)
                - // isApartment (boolean)
                - // dietType (string)
                - // foodPackaging (string)

                - // Refactor householdPoint for key in the object literal
                - // Calculates points for Food Diet Type based on WikiHow Method 1.                
                - // @param {string} dietType - Type of diet ('meatHeavy', 'average', 'vegetarian', 'vegan')
                - // @returns {number} Points for diet type.
