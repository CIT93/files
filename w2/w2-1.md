# Week 2.1 - Variables & Operators

## Code Along Instructions

## Steps

1.  **Create Project Files:**

- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz6pPx7zDFU) - Right click and open in a new tab or window

* In your **private repository**, create a new folder named `w2`.
* Inside `w2`, copy all the files (and their content) from your public `w1` folder. You should end up with:
    * `index.html`
    * `app.js`
    * `style.css`

* In the style.css add this at the bottom:
 ```css
 /* The .container class is defined but not strictly needed for this minimal HTML, but it's good practice to keep it consistent for future expansion. */
.container {
    max-width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto; /* Center the content */
    padding: 15px;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
    border-radius: 8px;
}
```
* **Git Workflow (Save Progress):**
    * Commit your changes with the message: **"Setup for w2 done"**
