1.  **Preparation**

* First off, head into the `w2` folder in your **private repository**.
* Before you start coding, create a new file named `app2-1.js` and copy all the code in your `app.js`into it.
* Then, open `app.js` and delete **all lines of code below** the very first `console.log()` statement.
* Remove the defer in the `index.html` from the script tag.
     * **Git Workflow (Save Progress):**
        * Commit your changes with the message: **"Backup 2.1 code"**
* Make sure you have Live Server running and let's get started.


2.  **Basic Page Interaction:**
* Code Along Part 1: Defer and Select HTML Elements
    - Same video as listed above
        - Comments to include
            - `index.html`
                - `<!-- paragraph tag with id = output-message -->`
                - `<!-- button tag with id = update-button -->`
            - `app.js`
                - // --- Part 1: Select HTML Elements ---- 
                - // We use document.getElementById() to get a reference to an element by its unique ID.
                - // We store these references in 'const' variables because the elements themselves won't change.
                - //These variables will change as the user interacts with the page.
            - `index.html`
                - Add defer attribute in an HTML <script>
        - Prompt to check out:

* Code Along Part 2: Define and call the handleButtonClick Function 
    - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_6LtnrOPjE) - Right click and open in a new tab or window
        - Comments to include
            - `app.js`
                - // --- Part 2: Define a Function that Reacts to a Click---
                - // A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
                - // Help me understand how arguments and parameters are used in functions
                - // Increase clickCount by 1 each time the button is clicked
                - // Template strings (literal) to easily combine our variables and text into one message
            - Prompts to check out:
                - Explain JavaScript functions, how to define them, and why they're useful.

        - Comments to include
            - `app.js`
                - // --- Part 3: Make the Button Clickable (Event Listener) ---
                - // This part ensures our JavaScript code runs only AFTER the HTML is fully loaded and parsed.
                - // The 'DOMContentLoaded' event is perfect for this. It fires when the HTML document is ready.
                - // Attach an event listener to our 'updateButton.
                - // When 'updateButton' receives a 'click' event, the 'handleButtonClick' function will execute.
            - Prompts to check out:
                - Explain what an event listener is in JavaScript, provide a simple example, and describe why they are essential for making web pages interactive.
                - Explain what the document object model represents in JavaScript, and provide simple examples of how it's used to access and modify HTML elements on a web page.

            - `app.js`
                - // This is basic decision-making in JavaScript!
                - // Use a simple 'if' statement to make our page react differently based on clickCount.
                - // We can even change the style of an HTML element directly with JavaScript!
                - // Change text color
                - // Update the text content of our paragraph element on the page.
                - // This is how JavaScript makes changes visible on the web page!
