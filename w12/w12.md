## Code Along Instructions
1. Setup `w12` folder from ending code from `w11`, make sure you have fixed any issues I mentioned you needed to fix before starting the next code along. 
    - Commit message: "Setup for w12 done"

2. Update the style.css with the following code
```css
/* after .note */
    .error-message {
        color: #dc3545; /* Red color for error messages */
        font-size: 0.9em;
        margin-top: 5px;
        display: block; /* Ensure it takes up its own line */
        text-align: left; /* Align error message to the left */
        font-weight: bold;
    }
```

3. I'll discuss how to do householdMembers and then you will code the rest, here are the id's to use, make sure to include the following content for each span - "remove after testing error message goes here". 

```
householdMembersError

    - Commit with message "HTML Update for FV error messages"

4. Now in your app.js create DOM references for each new error message created above using querySelector on the existing DOM reference for the form `carbonFootprintForm`.
