                - // Perform validation before proceeding
                - // Performs basic validation on form inputs.
                - // @param {Object} formData - The collected form data.
                - // @returns {boolean} True if validation passes, false otherwise.
                - // Named Arrow Functions - all functions use this standard going forward
                - console.log("Form validation failed. Stopping submission.")
                - // Stop execution if validation fails
                - console.log("Form validation passed. Proceeding with submission.");
